The work proposes a novel PCA algorithm using convex optimization.

Here are the data sets we consider: <br>
- Bank Marketing: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing. The size of the matrix is $45211 \times 15$ <be>
- Crop mapping using fused optical-radar data set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/525/crop+mapping+using+fused+optical+radar+data+set <br>
- Labeled Faces in the Wild: https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/ <br>
- Default of credit card clients: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients <br>
